# URL to Video - AI Powered Video Generator

A web application that converts a URL into a video using the power of AI. Users can enter a URL, and the application will generate a video with relevant content from that URL.

## Features

- **Convert URLs to Videos**: Generate videos by entering any valid URL.
- **Random Video Samples**: Displays random video samples from the server.
- **Real-time Loading Messages**: Shows loading messages during video generation.
- **AI-Powered Processing**: Uses AI to process and analyze the URL content for video creation.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for UI styling and components.
- **Backend**: (Assumed) API built with Node.js and Express, with endpoints for video creation and retrieval.
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for making API requests.

## Prerequisites

  - `/samples` - to get sample videos
  - `/create-story?url=` - to start the video generation process
  - `/build-video?id=` - to build and return the final video
